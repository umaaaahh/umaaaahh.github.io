        1) First Impression
        I immediately noticed the animation and movement on the initial loading page and how it reacted to my interactions. The way elements dynamically responded to my presence made the website feel immersive and modern. My first thought was, "How did they do that, and how can I apply similar techniques to my own web projects?"
        
        2) Two-Minute Interaction Breakdown
        Website Prompt	My Action	Website Response
        Website starts with credits to Frank Gehry and LA Phil	Brought my cursor onto the screen	A prompt appeared, "Click anywhere to enable sound," which followed my cursor dynamically
        Clicked to enable sound	Clicked the webpage	Animated text "Sculpting Harmony" appeared, followed by an educational subtext
        Hovered over “Sculpting Harmony”	Moved the cursor over the text	The text stretched, and snippets of Gehry’s quotes followed my cursor
        Prompt: "Scroll for story"	Scrolled up and down	Aerial footage of the concert hall zoomed in and out, making me question if it was a GIF or interactive video
        Scrolling further	Continued scrolling	Storytelling elements unfolded dynamically with visual transitions
        Arrived at "Ship in the Box"	Watched the video	A montage of Frank Gehry discussing his design process played
        Interactive 3D model prompt	Clicked to explore the model	Opened a detailed, interactive cardboard-like representation of the concert hall interior
        Icons on the model indicate interactivity	Clicked and rotated the model	Overlaid actual photographs appeared at the exact angle of the 3D view, adding an educational layer
        3) Most Engaging Part
        The 3D model of the concert hall was the most engaging. The ability to manipulate the structure, combined with overlays of real-life imagery, made the connection between digital and physical space feel seamless.
        
        4) Most Common Action
        Scrolling was the most frequent action. While it allowed fast navigation, it also controlled storytelling timing, creating a structured experience.
        
        5) Primary Goal
        The website aims to educate and immerse users in the design philosophy of Frank Gehry, while also showcasing the grandeur of the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
        
        6) Communicating the Goal
        Cutting-edge visual effects, layered storytelling, and interactivity mirror the monumental nature of the building itself.
        
        7) Interaction Over Time
        The website is a one-time deep-dive experience rather than a regularly revisited resource. It's designed for exploration rather than quick reference.
        
        8) Long-Term Interaction Communication
        The structured, linear storytelling encourages full engagement in a single sitting rather than returning multiple times.
        
        9) Media References
        Virtual museum exhibits
        Architectural visualization tools
        Documentary filmmaking
        10) Impact of Media References
        Encourages an active, exploratory approach rather than passive consumption.
        
        11) Emotional Impact
        Creates curiosity and inspiration, making architecture feel dynamic.
        
        12) Most Frustrating Aspect
        Some interactive icons on the 3D model could only be clicked from certain angles, causing slight usability friction.
        
        13) Most Satisfying Aspect
        The timing and interactivity were engaging, making what could have been a static experience feel immersive. The layered storytelling approach transformed 2D visuals into a 3D-like journey.
