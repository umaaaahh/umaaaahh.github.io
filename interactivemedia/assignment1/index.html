        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>
          I immediately noticed the animation and movement on the initial
          loading page and how it reacted to my interactions. The way elements
          dynamically responded to my presence made the website feel immersive
          and modern. My first thought was, "How did they do that, and how can I
          apply similar techniques to my own web projects?"

        <h3>1. First Impression</h3>
        <p>
          I immediately noticed the animation and movement on the initial
          loading page and how it reacted to my interactions. The way elements
          dynamically responded to my presence made the website feel immersive
          and modern. My first thought was, "How did they do that, and how can I

        <h3>2. Two-Minute Interaction Breakdown</h3>
        <p>
          Website Prompt My Action Website Response Website starts with credits
          to Frank Gehry and LA Phil Brought my cursor onto the screen A prompt
          appeared, "Click anywhere to enable sound," which followed my cursor
          dynamically Clicked to enable sound Clicked the webpage Animated text
          "Sculpting Harmony" appeared, followed by an educational subtext
          Hovered over “Sculpting Harmony” Moved the cursor over the text The
          text stretched, and snippets of Gehry's quotes followed my cursor
          Prompt: "Scroll for story" Scrolled up and down Aerial footage of the
          concert hall zoomed in and out, making me question if it was a GIF or
          interactive video Scrolling further Continued scrolling Storytelling
          elements unfolded dynamically with visual transitions Arrived at "Ship
          in the Box" Watched the video A montage of Frank Gehry discussing his
          design process played Interactive 3D model prompt Clicked to explore
          the model Opened a detailed, interactive cardboard-like representation
          of the concert hall interior Icons on the model indicate interactivity
          Clicked and rotated the model Overlaid actual photographs appeared at
          the exact angle of the 3D view, adding an educational layer
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box4">
        <h3>3. Most Engaging Part</h3>
        <p>
          The 3D model of the concert hall was the most engaging. The ability to
          manipulate the structure, combined with overlays of real-life imagery,
          made the connection between digital and physical space feel seamless.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box5">
        <h3>4. Most Common Action</h3>
        <p>
          Scrolling was the most frequent action. While it allowed fast
          navigation, it also controlled storytelling timing, creating a
          structured experience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box6">
        <h3>5. Primary Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The website aims to educate and immerse users in the design philosophy
          of Frank Gehry, while also showcasing the grandeur of the Walt Disney
          Concert Hall.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box7">
        <h3>6. Communicating the Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Cutting-edge visual effects, layered storytelling, and interactivity
          mirror the monumental nature of the building itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box8">
        <h3>7. Interaction Over Time</h3>
        <p>
          The website is a one-time deep-dive experience rather than a regularly
          revisited resource. It's designed for exploration rather than quick
          reference.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box9">
        <h3>8. Long-Term Interaction Communication</h3>
        <p>
          The structured, linear storytelling encourages full engagement in a
          single sitting rather than returning multiple times.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box10">
        <h3>9. Media References</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual museum exhibits Architectural visualization tools Documentary
          filmmaking
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box11">
        <h3>10. Impact of Media References</h3>
        <p>
          Encourages an active, exploratory approach rather than passive
          consumption.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box12">
        <h3>11. Emotional Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Creates curiosity and inspiration, making architecture feel dynamic.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box13">
        <h3>12. Most Frustrating Aspect</h3>
        <p>
          Some interactive icons on the 3D model could only be clicked from
          certain angles, causing slight usability friction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box14">
        <h3>13. Most Satisfying Aspect</h3>
        <p>
          The timing and interactivity were engaging, making what could have
          been a static experience feel immersive. The layered storytelling
          approach transformed 2D visuals into a 3D-like journey.
