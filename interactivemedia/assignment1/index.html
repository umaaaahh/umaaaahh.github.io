        <h3>1. First Impression</h3>
        <p>
          I immediately noticed the website has a sense of movement. Sometimes 
          that movement is done through an animated element, usually a transition,
         sometimes through scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dynamic responses to scrolls, hovers and clicks accompanied by expressive
          clasic music make the website feel vibrantly immersive and contempary. 
        </p>

          My first impressions while exploring the site where
          <strong>
            "How did they do that, and how can I
            apply similar techniques to my own web projects?"

        <h3>3. Most Engaging Part</h3>
        <div id="3d-model"></div>
        <p>
          The 3D model of the concert hall was the most engaging. The ability to
          manipulate the structure, combined with overlays of real-life imagery,
          made the connection between digital and physical space feel seamless.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box5">
        <h3>4. Most Common Action</h3>
        <p>
          Scrolling was the most frequent action. While it allowed fast
          navigation, it also controlled storytelling timing, creating a
          structured experience.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box6">
        <h3>5. Primary Goal</h3>
        <p>
          The website aims to educate and immerse users in the design philosophy
          of Frank Gehry, while also showcasing the grandeur of the Walt Disney
          Concert Hall.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box7">
        <h3>6. Communicating the Goal</h3>
        <p>
          Cutting-edge visual effects, layered storytelling, and interactivity
          mirror the monumental nature of the building itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box8">
        <h3>7. Interaction Over Time</h3>
        <p>
          The website is a one-time deep-dive experience rather than a regularly
          revisited resource. It's designed for exploration rather than quick
          reference.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box9">
        <h3>8. Long-Term Interaction Communication</h3>
        <p>
          The structured, linear storytelling encourages full engagement in a
          single sitting rather than returning multiple times.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box10">
        <h3>9. Media References</h3>
        <p>
          Virtual museum exhibits Architectural visualization tools Documentary
          filmmaking
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box11">
        <h3>10. Impact of Media References</h3>
        <p>
          Encourages an active, exploratory approach rather than passive
          consumption.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box12">
        <h3>11. Emotional Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Creates curiosity and inspiration, making architecture feel dynamic.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box13">
        <h3>12. Most Frustrating Aspect</h3>
        <p>
          Some interactive icons on the 3D model could only be clicked from
          certain angles, causing slight usability friction.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box box14">
        <h3>13. Most Satisfying Aspect</h3>
        <p>
          The timing and interactivity were engaging, making what could have
          been a static experience feel immersive. The layered storytelling
          approach transformed 2D visuals into a 3D-like journey.
