      <h3>1. First Impression</h3>
      <p>
        I immediately noticed the animation and movement on the initial loading
        page and how it reacted to my interactions. The way elements dynamically
        responded to my presence made the website feel immersive and modern. My
        first thought was, "How did they do that, and how can I apply similar
        techniques to my own web projects?"
      </p>
      <!-- need to figure out code for line breaks-->
      <h3>2. Two-Minute Interaction Breakdown</h3>
      <!-- Unsure how to make a table-->
      <p>
        Website Prompt My Action Website Response Website starts with credits to
        Frank Gehry and LA Phil Brought my cursor onto the screen A prompt
        appeared, "Click anywhere to enable sound," which followed my cursor
        dynamically Clicked to enable sound Clicked the webpage Animated text
        "Sculpting Harmony" appeared, followed by an educational subtext Hovered
        over “Sculpting Harmony” Moved the cursor over the text The text
        stretched, and snippets of Gehry's quotes followed my cursor Prompt:
        "Scroll for story" Scrolled up and down Aerial footage of the concert
        hall zoomed in and out, making me question if it was a GIF or
        interactive video Scrolling further Continued scrolling Storytelling
        elements unfolded dynamically with visual transitions Arrived at "Ship
        in the Box" Watched the video A montage of Frank Gehry discussing his
        design process played Interactive 3D model prompt Clicked to explore the
        model Opened a detailed, interactive cardboard-like representation of
        the concert hall interior Icons on the model indicate interactivity
        Clicked and rotated the model Overlaid actual photographs appeared at
        the exact angle of the 3D view, adding an educational layer
      </p>

      <h3>3. Most Engaging Part</h3>
      <p>
        The 3D model of the concert hall was the most engaging. The ability to
        manipulate the structure, combined with overlays of real-life imagery,
        made the connection between digital and physical space feel seamless.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Most Common Action</h3>
      <p>
        Scrolling was the most frequent action. While it allowed fast
        navigation, it also controlled storytelling timing, creating a
        structured experience.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Primary Goal</h3>
      <p> The website aims to educate and immerse users in the design philosophy
        of Frank Gehry, while also showcasing the grandeur of the Walt Disney
        Concert Hall.</p>

      <h3>6. Communicating the Goal</h3>
      <p>
        Cutting-edge visual effects, layered storytelling, and interactivity
        mirror the monumental nature of the building itself.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Interaction Over Time </h3>
      <p> 
        The website is a one-time deep-dive experience
        rather than a regularly revisited resource. It's designed for exploration
        rather than quick reference.
      </p>


      <h3>8. Long-Term Interaction Communication</h3>
      <p>
        The structured, linear storytelling
        encourages full engagement in a single sitting rather than returning
        multiple times.
      </p>
      

      <h3>9. Media References</h3>
      <p>
        Virtual museum exhibits Architectural visualization
        tools Documentary filmmaking
      </p>
       

      <h3>10. Impact of Media References</h3>
      <p>
        Encourages an active, exploratory approach
        rather than passive consumption.
      </p>
      

      <h3>11. Emotional Impact </h3>
      <p>
        Creates curiosity and inspiration, making
        architecture feel dynamic.
      </p>
      

      <h3>12. Most Frustrating Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        Some interactive icons on the 3D model could
        only be clicked from certain angles, causing slight usability friction.
      </p>
       

      <h3>13. Most Satisfying Aspect</h3>
      <p>
        The timing and interactivity were engaging,
        making what could have been a static experience feel immersive. The
       layered storytelling approach transformed 2D visuals into a 3D-like
      journey.
